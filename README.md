# EMS
A secure NestJS system where employees register/login via JWT authentication, create/manage tasks (CRUD operations), and view assigned tasks. MySQL stores user credentials  and task data (title, description, status). REST APIs handle user registration/, login , and task management . Role-based access ensures users only see their tasks.
